2020-02-26 0:00:00,4,"Really sweet, more coconut than almond flavor","I got this for my two oldest girls who are athletes and can polish off a bag of granola before I'm finished putting the tear off top in the trash.. The first thing they noted is that this granola is really sweet. They limit their sugar (I know, 12 and 13 and they don't like sugar? SMH) so they both ate small dishes and then sat it aside rather than cleaning it off like they normally would. It is crunchy without being too hard, a nice crunch without hurting their teeth. No big chunks that you have to break up before you can eat it. They felt the flavor balance was off, that it was more coconut than almond and would have liked the coconut to be toned down more.. It has all natural ingredients so my athletes like that they're eating clean, but they really wish there were less sugar in it. They've been using it as a bit of a treat, but a bag has lasted almost a week, which is unheard of in this house . . .","They felt the flavor balance was off, that it was more coconut than almond and would have liked the coconut to be toned down more.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZYQE9SD8FAQ3?ASIN=B07RXBFNHW

Honestly, you could probably fool a child that this was real meat. If you were looking for something vedgie tasting, this isn't for you.

In the second attempt, I boiled them twice with water for 30 minutes, and added even more gingers, then fried with oils. The smell persisted and I ended up throwing away all the rests.

Nick Nolte is at his absolute best in the part of the patriarch dealing with the onset of Alzheimers and as with most families, facing that reality is a painful journey. The story is brought to life through the eyes of Matilda, the granddaughter, who has a deep love and enduring patience for whatever hurdles her grandfather brings to the family unit. Moments of light humor, such as the grandfather accidentally setting off fireworks in the middle of a garden part, keep the movie from becoming gloomy. All the performances are very good but again, one so believes Nick Nolte's role as an aging and feeble man that they would believe that is his condition, until they remember his completely different role and award winning work in the television series Graves. If you're looking for a warm-hearted story with lovable characters and good fun, give this one a try.","Nick Nolte is at his absolute best in the part of the patriarch dealing with the onset of Alzheimers and as with most families, facing that reality is a painful journey.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T4DM3MNTLINO?ASIN=B07WK8JMVH

Then we serve it over rice or homemade naan. Dinner done, great for nights when you need a home meal fast! For three of us, we use two packets of sauce total for dinner.

The expeller-press canola oil has a pleasant, neutral flavor and the only other ingredient is lecithin rather than soy to help it remain non-stick. No aerosols -- yeay!. I've used it in stop top cooking and it works well there too. The cleaver spray nozzle lets you drip the oil out when only lightly pressed. This is great when I only want a little oil and use a paper towel to coat a surface. That said the misting sprayer works great as well. I used it to make waffles the other day and they released beautifully. This product is a winner and is worth paying a little more to have in my kitchen arsenal.. Best by July 2023.

2019-10-10 0:00:00,4,I like 'em okay,"Addressing flavor first, I thought these bars were pretty good. They look like they'd be as sweet as candy, but they aren't; they have a somewhat malty taste underneath the vanilla and almond. There is a slight lingering aftertaste, but it wasn't one that I found unpleasant. I see that some other reviewers strongly disagree with me about the flavor, so keep in mind that personal tastes differ.. Below I've charted a few nutritional figures comparing this bar with three other popular protein/energy bars. Note that the different flavors of all these bars have somewhat different numbers. As you can see, these Premier Protein bars rank fairly well against the competition:. Premier Protein:. Protein: 20g. Sugar: 1g. Carbohydrates: 20g. Calories: 230. Pure Protein:. Protein: 20g.

2021-07-16 0:00:00,5,Mix very very well before eating. Tasty.,"For the record I bought mine at Costco but it‚Äôs the same ‚Äúketo‚Äù mix with the macadamia nuts in it. First off, there is a lot (and I mean a lot) of oil separation straight from the store. If you‚Äôve ever bought almond butter before, probably double the separation oil in the jar. I mixed for several minutes with a knife and made sure the whole thing was mixed well. It was still way runnier than almond butter by a long shot.. Flavor... way tastier than almond butter and chunkier. I think it‚Äôs the coconut that makes the flavor better not the nuts themselves. I put mine in the fridge after the first serving. Consistency once refrigerated was a different animal. Almond butter was still slightly runny and spoonable refrigerated. Not so with this. It was more the consistency of crumbly graham cracker crust. Flavor was still the same. I actually preferred it refrigerated as texture was better and it melts in your mouth. Also being refrigerated means never having to stir it again.","First off, there is a lot (and I mean a lot) of oil separation straight from the store.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2S347BVI1P7AP?ASIN=B0849J95ND

After you cook the pasta, you just have to drain the water and then mix in the sauce in the same pan and it's ready!. Just remember that it's still ""Mac & Cheese"" and hence not necessarily something you should eat often since it's loaded with calories.

2021-03-21 0:00:00,4,Love the flavor but I need 2 bags,"I really love this rooibos chai. American versions of chai have far too much cinnamon, and authentic Indian chai doesn't taste anything like that. This chai is excellent. I add star anise to my homemade chai, which gives it incredible depth, and so i was attracted to the fact that they used star anise in this blend. I think it's a great chai because the spice blend is well-balanced, as it should be. My only issue is that I have to use two bags for one cup of tea. It's odd because I usually find rooibos to be quite strong. I never need two bags with a brand like Numi. IDK if that says something about the quality of the tea...whether it's old?

The texture is very similar to wheat pasta. This pasta doesn't have much flavor by itself but it takes on the flavor of whatever you're cooking it with very well. Highly recommend. My only gripe is how much more expensive it is than wheat pasta, but it seems to be a pretty good value compared to other soy pasta products and unfortunately eating healthy is not the cheapest way to eat..

2021-02-23 0:00:00,5,Cauliflower Pesto is a Revelation,"I've had this in my cupboard for a few months. If I'd known how good it was, I wouldn't have hesitated to try it. This pesto is a product of Italy and a great new spin on the cauliflower craze. Does it taste great as a pesto? Yes! 1000 times yes!. It says to eat within 3 days of opening, and I ate almost half a jar within 10 minutes of opening it.. Cauliflower, sunflower oil, parmesan and romano cheeses, pinenuts, salt, and pepper are the main ingredients in this pesto. There's also a little kick from the citric acid that helps to preserve it. The cauliflower takes on all the other ingredient flavors so that there's no cauliflower flavor really left.. I like to have breakfast and/or lunch of a few crackers with a nice spread on them. And this works great for that purpose. It would also be great on toast or as a mix-in with pasta or as a pizza sauce.

Pour in the batter when your skillet is nice and hot, and then into the oven.) It's great eaten with soupy meals, or meals with gravy. It can be slathered in butter and honey.

I like it mostly with mild greens to boost up the flavor. I also tried it as a seasoning in soup, but didn't care for it all that much.. The nutritional profile is impressive, with a wide range of vitamins and minerals. It has a good shelf life -- the pouch I received in December 2020 has a best by date of June 2022..

I found it acidic somewhat, but still completely drinkable.. Yes, i notice a difference between this coffee and coffee you get from higher end roasters. No doubt about it, it's there with every sip. But this coffee at less than half the cost of those brands I find to be satisfactory. And at that price point, that is still something to be pleased about.. So, in conclusion, this is actually good for the price I paid, but not the best coffee around by any means.. I would buy it again at that price point. I mean, really, it's quite a find at that price.. EDIT: I just tried adding a few grains of salt to cut the acidity, as suggested by another reviewer mentioned here, and i am happy to report that it works- a little salt makes a big difference!","And at that price point, that is still something to be pleased about.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3P92OG6WE6Y0K?ASIN=B01IQ9O05C

2020-07-15 0:00:00,4,Worth every penny!,"I love my Nespresso and recently picked up a Vertuoline machine to go with my workhorse that takes the original capsules. What I love about the Vertuoline machine and pods is that you can choose a pod that makes a larger cup of coffee than the original line capsules do and the machine knows exactly how to make the coffee based on what it reads on the pod. If you like good coffee and hate spending money on the sub par stuff served at starbucks, this capsule line is exactly for you.. These capsules are named americano which would imply an espresso shot with an addition of 4 to 12 ounces of hot water. This isn't exactly what you end up getting since the entire drink comes through the pod so if you are a coffee stickler you may be unhappy. I found it perfectly satisfactory.. I highly recommend either getting a variety pack of coffee pods or trying out a few at your local nespresso boutique before buying but once you find the pods you like, making quality coffee has never been this easy.",I love my Nespresso and recently picked up a Vertuoline machine to go with my workhorse that takes the original capsules.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3S17FJ8PI2HJW?ASIN=B07M98S5L5

I usually like a strong dark brew, but I‚Äôm sick of getting stuck with bad coffee, and I also always like to try the most basic variety of a brand to get a taste for it. Waited 4 weeks to get it home to put in my drip brewer and I was astonished. The aroma filled the house with a rich nutty smell. Even my wife who hates coffee had to sample it. This was by far the best coffee I have had in a long time. I‚Äôm scared to try the other varieties because I don‚Äôt want it to ruin my palette for its naturally rich sweet flavor.",Waited 4 weeks to get it home to put in my drip brewer and I was astonished.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBKJ8N2GUXA4J?ASIN=B07DF3VWG7

I give it 5 stars, though the sub categories of review were weird/strange. Easy to swallow really is just a reflection of your ability to swallow large gel caps (easy). Flavor also a strange one, gave it 5 stars because the capsules had no flavor/smell (good).

For another, unless you're drinking natural spring water (which is the only kind that makes sense to commercially bottle & the price these days is about the same!), it's actually depleting your body of the necessary minerals.

You can barely see the original formula on my skin on the left, since it immediately ""melts"" and disappears. This formula leaves a big white streak as you can see..

So it is best to eat ot straight from a spoon or as a spread or dip. I enjoy it in a beverage so I [eventually] dissolved it in a glass of unsweetened non-dairy vanilla milk. It was good in that and made it taste like a tootsie roll, or cold 'hot cocoa.' On it's own it literally tastes like very sweet honey with chocolate (a little too sweet for my liking on its own).

I'm not sure if anything was different in the texture, but it was similar to other non-Keto mug cake mixes I've tried in the past. It's close to the real thing, but not quite.. This is easy enough to make. Empty packet into a mug and stir in 4 tablespoons of cream. Then zap it in the microwave. The batter is definitely thicker than standard cake batter, but again, typical for this type of product. I licked the spoon before putting it in the sink, and the batter tastes great! I figured since there was no raw egg factor, it was fine. The cake is ok - maybe a bit on the dry side. If you did have heavy whipping cream and some Stevia or similar sweetener, making up some whipped cream for the top would be pretty nice. But if you're doing Keto hard-core, this would be a nice dessert option for you.","But if you're doing Keto hard-core, this would be a nice dessert option for you.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R378HKE7NLAJY3?ASIN=B085V62N6M

Somehow we missed that these were for Nespresso... We jail-broke them and tried brewing the coffee in a reusable pod on our Keurig though, and they were ok. I'm not sure if the brewing process in Nespresso is different than in Keurig - the coffee is ground MUCH finer, and perhaps it steeps longer, because I didn't find the taste in this coffee to be anything special. It was nowhere near as robust as the smell or description suggested.. It was fine, if a little bland, when made in my Keurig... But that's obviously not how it's intended to be brewed - so judge for yourself/from actual Nespresso reviews if you have the appropriate machine. If you find yourself, like me, the subject of an erroneous purchase though, you might want to use two capsules worth of grounds to brew each cup!","AROMISTICO | Premium Italian COFFEE CAPSULES 100% Compostable | FIRENZE BLEND Swiss Water DECAF | Compatible with Nespresso Machines | FULL BODIED, LIGHTLY SPICY & COCOA-Like.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20MSXZA0ATD5B?ASIN=B08M44YQQK

My initial hopes when I first purchased them was regarding finding something I could dip into some cheese spread, but they immediately break if you try to dip them into anything. I do understand that it‚Äôs difficult to make a crunchy, low carb, tortilla-style chip though..

2019-12-27 0:00:00,4,Joy's thoughts: Great idea - Flawed design,"I wanted to love this. First, let me say that the waffle maker itself works flawlessly!. The pour design idea is five stars - it says you need to clean it but as you can see in the video it did not require it. and as you can also see I am a messy baker!. The nonstick to date has been well... nonstick. The waffles come out easily. It is the design that is absolutely flawed - for me at least. One side flips down to remove the waffle and for easy cleaning. The problem is one side stays ALWAYS vertical. this greatly limits the waffle maker and what I can do. If someone wants chocolate chips and someone else prefers sprinkles - it is not going to happen. I would have to make two separate batches because you can not fill one side - then close and make vertical (does that make sense?. See the video it shows this).

2021-02-19 0:00:00,5,A sweet treat without being bad with my diet.,"I love certain Propel drinks. It's the flavors. I just have a couple flavors that don't appeal to my taste. I believe Grape has been my favorite. I've bought many of their bottled drinks in grocery stores. I don't recall seeing the powder packets in the stores. They might have been there and I just didn't notice. This Grape was first time I tried the packets. To me, they are Excellent. They are not over powering or heavy on sugar like canned soda. These are a good way for me to get the tastebuds satisfied and drink more water like I should. The Propel Grape just makes me want to drink the water faster. I still drink lots of water bottles without the flavor packers just because I think it's right for me. But when I want something with a sweet taste, I just put one of these packets in a bottle.",I love certain Propel drinks.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R167IXH4SE2U9K?ASIN=B082G3VX61
2020-09-03 0:00:00,5,Great Quality Protein and Taste,"I never get into the details as to whether or not a protein powder is better than others since it can be all so complex. With ON, we know that they are a reputable brand and arguably the most respected in when it comes to protein. Isolate is better for you than concentrate based on what I researched so I decided to give this a try. The powder does seem ""finer"" because it is isolate but that really doesn't matter to me or anyone else. The taste is very good. It tastes very similar to the ""Extreme Milk Chocolate"" Whey Concentrate they sell. Put this with some milk and it really is pretty good. With water, it tastes alright but to be fair, I have never had any protein powder with water that comes out super good. Hence why I will use Fat Free Milk just so it can have that ""milkshake"" taste and consistency. All in all, this is definitely my go to product and I love the taste. I plan on buying this consistently for the time being.

This didn't used to be the case. The one shipped to me on August 18, 2021 was packaged in April 2020. That's too old y'all. Just plain disappointing.. I'm not going to return them because it's a small hassle and I wanted to use some of the beans in this last package to test for flavor and quality. The aroma from the release valve on front was good, so I thought I'd try. The coffee was less aromatic, less creamy, and less flavorful than usual.. I get that the older beans might be a carry over from Covid. These are imported beans...and so on. But selling premium beans more than a year old to people who can't check the packaging for themselves shouldn't be an option.",But the last two or three month's shipments (at least) have had manufacture/packaged dates of at least 6 months old.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROIKZRKQ0PPS4?ASIN=B00MHTBG5A

The reviews I read indicated you could reheat this on a gas stove burner. The insert in the box says the opposite and the glass is so thin I can't imagine how that could be possible. Every time I set it down on our granite countertop, I'm afraid it's going to shatter in my hand. The mesh filter that came with it is worthless. The water nearly runs straight through it and makes coffee that's weaker than herbal tea, lol. We have to use a paper filter inside of the mesh filter, which is wasteful and defeats the purpose of wanting the mesh filter. The whole thing is pretty. That's about it.

I just don't remember Vega being this ridiculously gritty. It's like drinking flour, not quite a cornmeal, but you can feel the texture as you drink it. Very unpleasant. The flavor too is heavily pea protein and not coffee. I tried to make it like a nice cold ice coffee and ended up needing to add actual cold brew and milk to try to make it palatable. It was still not enjoyable and I had to regularly shake it up again as the pea protein settles.. Today I added a teaspoon to a cup of hot coffee and now my coffee tastes less like coffee and more like pea protein. I'm hoping to find a way to use this up without having to drink it, but it might end up in the trash.. I don't personally see a need to add MCT oil.

It's ridiculously filling and has really helped me stay within my calorie allotment. Nothing can do that for me the way casein does except for maybe chicken breast.. I also add about a half teaspoon to my coffee with a splash of 1% milk, and the coffee becomes very creamy and light colored. No need for whole milk or half and half! I mix with whey protein sometimes too, but the casein is incomparable for imparting a creamy texture and pale color while filling you up for hours. I wouldn't use it by itself as a shake, because it has kind of a weird overly milky flavor (hard to explain) when all you're tasting is the casein. In that case, add in some whey to balance the flavor.. I prefer something like this without all the additives of the typical protein powders. I always add what I want to it anyway: stevia, salt, flavorings, sometimes even xanthan gum.

I use 12-14 oz of water to brew the perfect cup for me.. I like Human Bean House Roast but sometimes the foil top opens too wide causing grounds to get in my cup & clog the kcup drawer. This is usually an easy fix with the MyCafe Bunn by rinsing the drawer to dislodge coffee grounds from one of the puncture devices. Nevertheless, it is an irritating problem.

Of course, if one has time to grind every day that would be best, but freezing helps keep the flavor very well. Light roasts tend to have a higher amount of caffeine, too..

2020-08-20 0:00:00,4,The Peruvian bean is definitely a bit mild,"I'm a recovering coffee fanatic. I've spent way too much money, and time on brewing gear, and supplies. I'm at the point where simple is best, and many times, a good cup of plain ol' American coffee is what I need. So, I picked up these in my never-ending quest to find a bean that meets my needs.. That said, these are very mild, I'd say, more of a light roast flavor than medium. There's not much character to the flavor profile, nothing that truly lingers, perhaps a hint of nuttiness, which I do enjoy. Just not enough of it.. The price is probably fair for what you get, but the next experiment would be with a bolder variety, perhaps a Kenyan.","There's not much character to the flavor profile, nothing that truly lingers, perhaps a hint of nuttiness, which I do enjoy.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DLU1QMHGI1OA?ASIN=B0721MHJKX

Obviously I am NOT buying it again. This is not helping Amazon to establish a nice tea marketplace. So you lost a potentially devoted customer for seeking higher profits. Truth is -good- first flush teas aren't cheap, but this offering was average. The leaf cut was even not uniform (looked like a blend from different products) and the flavor profile was good, but not great.

I'm glad that I was able to try out the Good Earth Sensorial Tropical Mango and Moringa Herbal Tea.. Flavor/Scent:. The thing that stood out to me quickly is the scent of the tropical mango with the tea bags. You can smell it right away and will continue to overpower most of the tea smell once you start steeping the tea in hot water. It's a pleasant smell and isn't pungent or anything like that though. I recommend steeping it a little longer than the recommended just because you want to get all the flavor into your tea. What I found was that each tea bag produced a little bit of a different strength of tea regardless of how long you soak. However, as for the taste, the mango taste isn't as strong and it is a good refreshing flavor that isn't too overpowering..

Take out the tea bags, stir it up, put it in the fridge to chill & you have the most refreshing & great tasting tea. I haven't used brewed tea since the day I tried Lipton Cold Brew. I have tried three other brands of cold brew tea when Lipton wasn't available where I shop but I came back to Lipton before I ever finished the other brands.

The powder mixes pretty easily -- but you do need to mix it for a bit so that it gets entirely absorbed. It also acts as a thickener, so keep that in mind when adding to casseroles, etc. I really like adding it to watery soups as it thickens it up and makes the soup a bit more hearty to eat. But note that it does give whatever you add it to a taste of ""peas"". Not bad at all, but it will slightly take on that aroma. So not something you want to add to your oatmeal! Overall, a great product. But I use it primarily in soups for lunch or casserole-type meals for dinner. Others mentioned that the taste seemed rancid or bad -- never had that problem.

Any minor disturbance in the powder results in a cloud of dust and makes a mess just like corn starch or waxy maize.

That being said, there are many ways to take probiotics but if you don't like pills or yogurt, this sparkling water is not a bad option.. Overall, this drink is decent but pricey.

The flavor reminds me of cherry pop lollipops. It doesn't get me too tingly (which I don't mind), and gives me a good amount of energy, it also helps with recovery speed. I feel way less fatigued and recover faster. This affects significantly the amount of work or reps that I'm able to put in. I take it before my workouts and it helps me a lot!. I didn't find it too strong as I've read some other reviews, I was even a bit cautious after reading some of the reviews. If you already take different pre-workouts, this should not be too strong..

Many medium roasts are just too weak tasting for me but I REALLY enjoyed this one! This is much better than your average mainstream grocery store brand.. In my experience, K-Cups often taste different than freshly brewed coffee. Yes, they are more convenient but the taste is not comparable to a freshly, finely ground (from a whole bean) coffee. I have to say, this came pretty darn close. I was quite impressed with the freshness and pleasantly surprised.. The true test is how well the coffee tastes black with no additional additives. This one can really stand on its own! I actually enjoyed the taste of the coffee black. That normally isn't the case for me, mainly because a lot of the coffee we buy is darker roasts.

So either sell less and bring the price down or place the 40 pods in a bigger box, because somethings got to give here. Luckily I only had 1 that was partially open, but usable (I used this opened one as my water amount tester). Two of my pods were a little crushed, but I was able to shape it back into its natural form. If you use 8 ounces of water the flavor is on point. Don't use 6 ounces of water it will leave a lot of Hot Chocolate Mix inside the pods after its done spewing your Hot Cocoa. Also, don't use 10 ounces, it'll be more of a muted flavor.

My mode of preparation was using a mesh cup made to fit in our K machine so other types of coffee can be used. I used the 6 oz. setting to get the full flavor experience of this coffee. Was slightly disappointed as it wasn't as strong as I hoped, more like a regular cup of coffee from a regular brand. I admit that I've been fixing some Espresso coffees lately and that could be why this Iowa Native one seemed a bit weak. The coffee is actually quite good, is made using Organic Arabica Beans, and is 100% Fair Trade Certified - that's always good. I usually add some milk to mellow out some of the stronger coffees, but this coffee was tasty just by itself!","The coffee is actually quite good, is made using Organic Arabica Beans, and is 100% Fair Trade Certified - that's always good.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2F92Q30G3B0HC?ASIN=B087WWV246

I make no concessions... there shouldn't be *anything* about my coffee that takes away from the simple pleasure of enjoying a cup. If a prepackaged iced coffee/coffee concentrate is too acidic, too bitter, or has that funky mass produced mouthfeel, I'm dumping it. I've tried more brands than I can count, from what's at my local grocery store to mainstream brands to online-only brands. Javy is the only thing that checks all of my boxes so far. It's smooth. It mixes well with everything I've thrown at it: water, half-and-half, heavy cream, and a variety of syrups. It's a convenient size for storing and (huge bonus) traveling with.

The wife actually likes this stuff, she said the powder/flake stuff I had bought before had a aftertaste she didn't like (I didn't notice it). But this stuff does have a odd scent, kind of like confectioners sugar but it also somewhat smells like vanilla, you don't notice it in the taste tho..

Soooo I tried to be economically mindful and pocketbook friendly and just barista at home. This has been a great addition to my coffee bar lineup!

Cons: the burps are NASTY and this does not taste fabulous at 9am by itself. But it gets the job done with minimal interruptions. I notice it keeps me fuller longer and no bad cravings in the mornings and even through lunchtime..

I think the 4.87oz has one more than this one. Individual pieces are in the same size of both packaging. Another difference I noticed is that this one has serving size of 3 squares. The other one has serving size of 1 square. lol. The ingredients are same. 1g of added sugar to a square of chocolate is very hard to find, this is a good one that I want to feed my family.

Every episode is different because every story is based on a different article written by a different person. You can totally pick and choose. They are not connected at all. I LOVED watching these and then going back and reading the articles they were based off of to see the similarities and differences. Some of the pieces stick to the original story very well and some were edited a bit for television. If you like short stories and glimpses into the love lives of real people you will like this series. I really hope they make a season 2!",Every episode is different because every story is based on a different article written by a different person.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVIOGJAKD4QLL?ASIN=B08764YQSD

2021-06-09 0:00:00,4,Very good,These aren't Oreos. I bet this is a controversial sounding sort of opinion but I really don't like Oreos. The cookie flavor is awful.. These are more like a chocolate flavored cookie and the taste is a bit dry and sort of bland for chocolate but that seems to work with the cream filling. The two sort of compliment one another. I liked them.. It's sort of hard to judge whether or not you get value for money in these because I couldn't see the price. My feeling is that as long as you aren't paying more than around $3.50 ish then you are getting a generous amount of cookie for the money.. I also tried the single stuff cream version of these and those are basically wafer thin. Stick with double stuffed.

Usually their droppings are in a neat pile but the droppings now looked like they had been fired out of a shotgun. Kind of gives them a gentle reminder on the way out.

Superheroes are often showed to save humans lives, but it is not often true. And people admired that superhero. I think It is not good to always have a supernatural gift. And this show shed some light on the true reality of being gifted. The screenplay is very strong. And I like that the most characters are not very well-known Hollywood. And they played really well. There is also lots of cool action going on the show. Usually action genre may lack good screen play, but the boys is very different.

We ground the beans fine for an espresso machine and the entire kitchen filled with an usually strong (and delicious) aroma of coffee. I could get addicted to the smell alone, but I digress.. The crema was medium sized in depth but flavorful and long-lasting in the cup. The coffee is full-bodied and rich, with notes of chocolate and smoky molasses. There is no bitterness and a slight but pleasing acidity. The unexpected nature of this coffee is how its flavor seems to change in the cup to a lighter, wine-like elegance over time. Its flavor appears to smooth without losing its robust qualities. The finish is long and filled with pleasant memories as the coffee disappears. I recommend this excellent dark roast for its rich flavor and its absolutely ""killer"" aroma.","I could get addicted to the smell alone, but I digress.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BX2SATAQIYYZ?ASIN=B08XBMV7B6

2020-06-25 0:00:00,5,One of the best! Slight apprehension about ingredients,"My family loves David Rio chai after being introduced to the brand by a local coffee shop. Rather than paying $5/glass we decided to purchase it in bulk. We have tried Tiger Spice and Elephant Vanilla and so far the Tiger Spice is the proven favorite.. The chai is powdered and dissolves well in warm/hot water or milk. My tip for making iced chai is to dissolve a few teaspoons in hot water first until it becomes a concentrated liquid, then add your milk and ice. It will have a much smoother taste than trying to dissolve the powder directly into cold water or milk.. The only downside to this chai? It's high in sugar and has added ingredients which are troublesome, particularly saturated fat. Consequently I only enjoy it on rare occasions, but other members in my household drink it frequently. I would love if David Rio could produce a version that leaves out the saturated fat and some of the additives. Otherwise, it's a great treat, but a high calorie one.",The only downside to this chai?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R386B6HZ8WIZAJ?ASIN=B0000UBTY6

Tried light roasts from multiple places, including the company with a blue color bottle as logo but none of them really blew my socks off compare to my favorites from a place selling $20/8oz before shipping. This is until I tried Coffee Bros ordered via Amazon. The best brew at reasonable price point is hands down the Light Roast from Coffee Bros. The complexity, floral smell and the right amount of acidity makes this a forever staple in breakfast brew rotation. A big plus side is also how easily it is to achieve a good brew, and the flavors are aplenty so not as much beans are needed to achieve strong flavors I prefer nowadays. 10/10 would recommend for light roast lovers.",Had the pleasure of trying some niche premium roasters but the high cost isn't sustainable for daily drinking.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DFAONQ8TSNWM?ASIN=B07WK8Q42W

2020-12-09 0:00:00,1,Truly a disappointment. Go for another brand!,"2.5% Retinol Serum by Eva Naturals:. I had read other reviews stating that the product seemed watered down and rendered no sensation when applied. I was hoping that maybe that was a fluke or perhaps it was just a weak batch. Sadly, I took the risk, so that you don't have to. This stuff is very weak. There is absolutely no way this serum is 2.5% retinol. There is no tingling, there is no burning. I hate to use the word 'burning', but let‚Äôs be honest, this is a chemical that you put on your face to fight wrinkles and there should be some indication that it is working due to some level of discomfort and there is none. Additional ingredients include vitamin E and hyaluronic acid, which is not supposed to sting, so this stuff is basically a moisturizing serum. But that is the issue.

I personally prefer matte or light chapsticks but because O'Keefes promises moisturize in one use, it tends to be a little too thick for my liking but that's the point, I'm sure. The size and shape is perfect. Because of the unique oval shape, I am able to put this in a molle style vest or backpack. It's ideal for military or LEO. The only flaw that I found (hence the 4 stars) which is important to me, is that all 4 sticks (4pack) would not roll back down upon twisting. Instead, you have to push it back in to the tube, which was inconvenient for me but might not bother others.

No matter how slowly I try to push, so I can get just a tiny bit, it'll randomly just give a big squirt. Then I basically waste a very expensive product all over the counter.

I don't wear foundation and generally wont wear a powder either so wearing regular (liquid) sunscreen often leaves my skin feeling greasy or dewy with an oily appearance.

I had hoped that the smell would dissipate once the salt dissolved in my bath, but no such luck. It remained super strong during the entire duration, plus it clung to my body and long hair for many many hours afterwards.. Needless to say, I don't enjoy this bath salt at all.

I tried this based on reviews and it is amazing. It has got rid of most of the dryness/flaking on my upper lip. I was concerned I would not be able to use it as I have super sensitive skin and a lot of things irritate my face. This is not irritating. It does have a light scent (which I usually don't like) but it is not bothering me at all. It goes on so smooth and sheer. I'm even using it on my hands and elbows for moisturizing. It is a tad greasy but it is natural oils so you have to be willing to accept that. it is a little messy to use - again it is oil.

My favorite has a brush much like an eyelash brush; it separates the hairs and deposits color on all of them. The downside is that the wand often gets caught in my curly hair and comes out covered with hairs. This one is much cleaner to use in that respect; it doesn't tangle in my hair, but it also doesn't easily get down into my hair and color everything. Still, the color is very good and what it does touch it covers well, and it sticks well too. It will come off if you touch it, like all of these products, so I rub a tissue on it to get off any obvious excess.

It is a flawless dewy finish.. The reason some people have problems with it is that their airbrush compressor does not have a high enough PSI S/B formula. You need at least 30 PSI.. Lower may work but it either takes too long or cannot push out the makeup successfully... If you don't have an airbrush.. Try a stipple. Brush instead. I use an Iwata Medea studio series power jet pro compressor with an Iwata eclipse airbrush.... It's huge but I use it for other stuff I do.. Temptu makes some nice more portable compressors..they have a 40 PSI I believe.. That's what you would need for this makeup.... I don't use anything else.

Sure it's after months of use but still I wish it wouldn't do that. It'll still close, it just takes a bit more effort to line it up properly. Since this is a thich cream based product ( more like stage makeup), a little goes a long way and blending is key. It's the best concealer I've ever found!

This liquid lipstick has a Carmel smell, that I find a little too tart--t's still a good smell- and I can't smell it anymore once I've applied the product to my lips.. This formula seems the same as the last one, but now that I've used it for a few days I'm finding that it has a lingering stick that the old ones didn't have. My guess is that has something to do with the added smell- because thats the only change I've noticed to the product. It's not too bad, but I was a little disappointed- I need to add some powder if I I want the stick to go away- but im someone that sometimes adds eyeshadow to the center of my lips anyways, so it's good for that.. Still! This doesn't transfer and the longevity seems the same--that's all good!.

Wash your feet before and after. Use the socks for roughly 60-90 minutes. The dead skin will fall off within a few days leaving your feet smooth.

If you don't have the hairs to dye, don't buy this stuff.. - You DO NOT need to use an entire capsule for each application. I get about 4-5 applications out of each capsule. Just open it, dump a little bit into the mixing cup, and put it back together to save for later. I do a 1/1 mixture (eyeballing it) of the powder to the cream.. - This WILL stain your clothes if you aren't careful.. - I reapply every 10 to 14 days or when I see that my brows are getting light again.",It does dye your skin a bit so be careful to only put it where you want color.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1G0X20AGJ1DNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EEN2HCS

It's also good to give your nose and T-zone a good dying out. From what I am able to tell, it works really well.. The only thing that can get a little tricky is that once it is applied, it leaves a translucent pinkish clown white sort of appearance on your skin. It dries super fast, so trying to race against time before it dries on you before spreading further, just doesn't work. Besides, you want that lotion there anyway. That's why this lotion may be best used either at night or during a day when you plan on staying home. Also, for spot work when you are going out but are a bit desperate..

Wow, I figured I would give it a try on alternate water/ground/ground fineness on my burr grinder but no luck. I resorted to making cold brew because sometimes the bitter is not captured as much; no such luck, the burnt dirt flavor came thru. I really wanted to save this from the trashcan by trying since it is a huge 2 lb bag. Amazon says I cannot return because I didn't buy it. Amazon also says mil cannot return it.

2020-06-10 0:00:00,3,It's Average coffee - but I'm little but of a coffee snob,"This 1850 Black Gold Dark Roast is good, average, but not AMAZING. I purchased this because of the sale price & reviews. To be honest, I can be a bit of a coffee snob. I own a Keurig, Nespresso, Ceramic pour over & a French press. I preface my review that I love dark, strong, bold & black coffee. I don't put any cream, sweetener or flavorings in my coffee and a purist of sorts. This coffee to ME taste more like a medium blend and seems little weak to be called a dark roast with a 8oz brew cup. I would prefer a cup of Green Mountain Dark Magic over this any day. This will be what I serve my guests who like an average cup of coffee or like to make their cup foo foo-ish.","I own a Keurig, Nespresso, Ceramic pour over & a French press.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BB24YNBOX6Y5?ASIN=B07B43QWL3
